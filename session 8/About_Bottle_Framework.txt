					Bottle (Python Web Framework)






Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It is distributed as a 
single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.




INSTALLATION :
______________



-->In terminal go to created virtual environment and activate it.

-->To activate virtual environment (source bin/activate)
pip install bottle 



Example :
_________



# index.py in a bottle



# import required things

from bottle import route, run, template



@route('/home/')

def index():
    
    return template('<b>Welcome to our website home page</b>')



run(host='localhost', port=8000, debug = True, reloader = True)





Code explanation :
__________________

route() : 


-->The "Debug mode"( optional parameter) is very helpful during early development.

-->The "reloader"( optional parameter) its very useful to reload the browser when we change any code.

--> The route() decorator binds a piece of code to an url path. We can define as many routes as we want.

--> When ever a browser requests a URL, the associated function is called and return the value is sent back to the browser.




template() :


-->Bottle comes with a fast and powerful build-in template engine called SimpleTemplateEngine.

-->To render a template we can use the template() function or the view()decorator.




run() :

       
-->The run in last line starts a build-in development server. 

-->Its runs on localhost post port 8000 and servesrequests until we hit Control-c in terminal.





Run the code :

______________

-->Run the script in terminal then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/home/ That’s it.
-->To stop running hit Control-c in terminal.
